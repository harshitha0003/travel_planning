# travel_planning
The Travel Planning System using Deep Learning leverages AI algorithms to provide personalized travel recommendations based on user preferences such as budget, destination, and travel style.

/* Technologies Used
Python
Tkinter (GUI)
Scikit-learn (KNN, TF-IDF)
Pandas
Matplotlib (for visualization)

/* How to Use
Upload Travel Dataset: Click the "Upload Travel Dataset" button to select the dataset directory.
Preprocess Dataset: Click "Preprocess Dataset" to prepare the data for analysis.
Build Collaborative & Clustering Model: Click "Build Collaborative & Clustering Model" to generate the model for recommendations.
Train KNN Algorithm: Click "Train KNN Algorithm" to train the recommendation system on the provided data.
Input Your Requirements: Enter your travel preferences in the input box (e.g., desired destination category and places).
Predict Recommendation: Click "Predict Recommendation" to get the recommended tourist destination and nearby places.

/* Features:
Dataset Upload: Allows users to upload a travel dataset containing information about users and destinations.
Dataset Preprocessing: Processes the uploaded dataset, handling missing values and preparing it for analysis.
Collaborative Model Building: Creates a collaborative model using user preferences and tourist places data to generate travel recommendations.
KNN Training: Trains a KNN algorithm using TF-IDF vectorization to analyze and generate recommendations based on user input.
Travel Prediction: Takes user input (e.g., preferred category and places) and suggests personalized tourist destinations along with nearby places, distance, duration, and ratings.
User-Friendly GUI: Simple interface using Tkinter for easy interaction with the system.
